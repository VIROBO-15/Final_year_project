# Breast Cancer
**Breast cancer** is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection helps in reducing the number of early deaths. The data reviews the medical images of breast cancer using ultrasound scan. Breast Ultrasound Dataset is categorized into three classes: normal, benign, and malignant images. Breast ultrasound images can produce great results in classification, detection, and segmentation of breast cancer when combined with machine learning.

**Breast cancer** is a complex disease. There are several subtypes of breast cancer and many options for treatment. While many people may have similar diagnoses or are prescribed similar treatments, no two peopleâ€™s experiences are exactly the same.

# Diabetic Retinopathy
            The most common type of retinopathy is related to diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy can be proliferative (growing) or nonproliferative (not growing), referring to the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Nonproliferative retinopathy is much more common and may not require treatment. In proliferative retinopathy, abnormal blood vessels start to grow when the existing blood vessels close off. The proliferative type of retinopathy can lead to impaired vision. Regular eye examinations are important to check for progression of retinopathy from nonproliferative to proliferative stages.
            The public database contains at the moment 15 images of healthy patients, 15 images of patients with diabetic retinopathy.
