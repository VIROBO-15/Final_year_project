## Breast Cancer

**Breast cancer** occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor originates in the breast. As breast cancer tumors mature, they may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. The primary route of metastasis is the lymphatic system which, ironically enough, is also the body's primary system for producing and transporting white blood cells and other cancer-fighting immune system cells throughout the body. Metastasized cancer cells that aren't destroyed by the lymphatic system's white blood cells move through the lymphatic vessels and settle in remote body locations, forming new tumors and perpetuating the disease process.
**Breast cancer** is a complex disease. There are several subtypes of breast cancer and many options for treatment. While many people may have similar diagnoses or are prescribed similar treatments, no two peopleâ€™s experiences are exactly the same.

## Data

The data collected at baseline include breast ultrasound images among women in ages between 25 and 75 years old. This data was collected in 2020. The number of patients is 600 female patients. The dataset consists of 780 images with an average image size of 500*500 pixels. The images are in PNG format. The ground truth images are presented with original images. The images are categorized into three classes, which are ***normal,benign and malignant***.

Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall. There were over 2 million new cases in 2020.
## DATASET
The public database contains 266 images of **normal**, 891 image of **benign**, 421 image of **maligent**

# Diabetic Retinopathy

The most common type of retinopathy is related to diabetes. **Diabetic retinopathy** can be **proliferative** (growing) or **nonproliferative** (not growing), referring to the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Nonproliferative retinopathy is much more common and may not require treatment. In proliferative retinopathy, abnormal blood vessels start to grow when the existing blood vessels close off. The proliferative type of retinopathy can lead to impaired vision. Regular eye examinations are important to check for progression of retinopathy from nonproliferative to proliferative stages.
## DATASET
The public database contains 15 images of **healthy patients**, 15 images of **patients with diabetic retinopathy**.**Binary gold standard vessel segmentation** images are available for each image. Also the masks determining **field of view (FOV)** are provided for particular datasets. The gold standard data is generated by a group of experts working in the field of retinal image analysis and clinicians from the cooperated ophthalmology clinics. We intend to add further gold standard data to the existing images to help the evaluation of algorithms which localize the macula, optic disc, or differentiate between arteries and veins.
